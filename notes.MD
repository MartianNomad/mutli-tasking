# Transfer learning

1. Heterogenous learning
    Feature space between source and target domains are non-equivalent and 
    generally non-overlapping.
    requires feature transformation ans handling cross-domain data distribution difference
    
    Feature transformation
    a. assymetric transformation
        Transform the source domain feature space to align with target domain or 
        vice-versa
        Most appropriate when the source and target domain have the same class label
    b. symmetric transformation
        Project both source and target feature onto a common subspace
